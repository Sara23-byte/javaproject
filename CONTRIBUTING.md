# Contributing

Thank you for thinking about contributing! Please keep changes small and explain the reasons behind them.

- Report issues with a brief description and a sample input if you can.
- For code changes, focus on one feature or bug per pull request and include a short example of input and output.
- Update tests to reflect new behavior.
- Use clear commit messages, such as:
  - "Clarify scoring rationale in Analyzer.java"
  - "Improve README description and quick start"
